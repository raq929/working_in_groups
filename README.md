Working in Groups

A tutorial on how to work in groups in the (tech) workplace

##How to tell if you're working in a group
If the answer to any of these questions is no, you're probably not working in a group.
* Are you asking and answering questions?
* Are you talking to other people?
* Are you looking at other people?

##How to create a good group environment
* Ask your teammate how they learn best
* Find out what you're teammates interests are outside of class/work
* Ask your teammates what they struggle with/ what challenges they've had
* Ask your teammates what they are good at
* Remember that people often need sympathy before advice

##I understand everything we're supposed to be doing
What should I do?
* Ask your teammates if they have questions
* Ask your teammates how they're doing
* Ask your teammates to walk you through their code/planning process
* Listen to your teammates explain their issues
* Ask your teammates how they feel about the project

What should I avoid doing?
* Saying "This is easy."
* Telling people not to feel they way they feel

##I'm confused about what we're supposed to be doing
What should I do?
* Ask your teammates to stop what they are doing
* Formulate a [clear question](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-project-full-stack-app/issues/7) if possible
* Ask your teammates to walk through the code/planning process
* Tell your teammates how you feel

What should I avoid?
* Panicking. "I can't do this" is less productive than, "I can't do this yet, can you help me."
* Pretending that you understand.

##Mixed-gender groups
It's pretty well documented that women often are overlooked in mixed-gender groups. Luckily, you don't have to be a part of this problem. Here are some ways that you can support the women in your group.
* Don't interrupt them when they are talking
* Publicly acknowledge the work that they do
* Give them credit for their ideas
* If they haven't spoken in a while, ask them if they have anything to add

But I'm not "one of those guys!" Great! Women have experienced so many of "those guys" in their lives that unfortunately, you will have to put in some extra effort to make it clear that you're not one of them. Thanks!

##Things to Remember
Working as a team helps everyone, even if (maybe especially if) teammates are on different levels. More experienced team members gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter by explaining it to less experienced teammates, and they gain experience at explaining their code. They also learn how to explain things to people with different learning styles.
